What happens after I fill out a form?
Donors: You will receive a confirmation email and your donation request will immediately be posted for matchers to see. We will email you again when your request is matched along with the matcher's email so that you can get in contact.
Matchers: Reach out to your donor using the information in the confirmation email. After getting in touch with your BonoBuddy, you should donate the agreed amount, have your company match the donation, and then have the donor reimburse you.

What if I do not receive a confirmation email?
If you do not receive an email from us within a few minutes of filling out the form, you may have incorrectly entered your information or used an invalid company email. If you think this is the case, you can either resubmit a form or contact us at teambonobud@gmail.com.

How long are donation postings available?
We respect your time and want your donation to have the biggest impact possible. That is why each donation request will be posted for a maximum of 2 weeks on our site. We will then notify the donor so that they can donate directly to the charity.

Can I make more than one donation request or match more than one donation?
Yes, definitely. As a donor or matcher, feel free to submit as many forms as you can commit to. Remember that it is a waste of time if you do not actually intend on donating.

What if my BonoBuddy doesn’t respond?
If the donor or matcher that you are working with becomes unresponsive, they may not wish to donate anymore. However, some people check their emails more frequently than others. Be patient and remember that both parties receive each other’s email addresses. Don’t be afraid to start the conversation!
If your BonoBuddy falls through, we encourage you to choose another donation to request or match!

What if I do not trust my BonoBuddy?
If your matcher or donor seems untrustworthy, do not feel pressured to continue the conversation. Report any suspicious activity immediately by sending an email to teambonobud@gmail.com. Note that this is our one and only official email address.
